//join => join is used to connect any string or value into the array and convert it into string. if we add one value inside the join method then the value will be repeated on each values in the array exp:
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
let var1 = arr.join(" newNum ");
console.log(var1);

//here you can see that this is actually being converted into string.
console.log(typeof var1);
